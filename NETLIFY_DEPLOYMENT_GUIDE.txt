    NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT GUIDE FOR BEGINNERS
    Rushendra Nuthi's Portfolio
==================================================

This guide will walk you through deploying your portfolio to Netlify step by step.

PREREQUISITES:
- Your portfolio project files (already have these!)
- A GitHub account (free)
- A Netlify account (free)

==================================================
STEP 1: PREPARE YOUR PROJECT FOR GITHUB
==================================================

1. Create a GitHub Repository:
   - Go to github.com and sign in to your account
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
   - Select "New repository"
   - Name it: "rushendra-nuthi-portfolio" (or any name you prefer)
   - Make it PUBLIC (required for free Netlify deployment)
   - Don't initialize with README (you already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Initialize Git in Your Project:
   - Open Terminal/Command Prompt
   - Navigate to your project folder:
     cd /Users/rushendra/Downloads/rushendra-nuthi's-portfolio
   
   - Initialize git repository:
     git init
   
   - Add all files:
     git add .
   
   - Make your first commit:
     git commit -m "Initial commit: Portfolio website"

3. Connect to GitHub Repository:
   - Copy the repository URL from GitHub (it will look like: https://github.com/yourusername/rushendra-nuthi-portfolio.git)
   - Add the remote origin:
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/rushendra-nuthi-portfolio.git
   
   - Push to GitHub:
     git push -u origin main

==================================================
STEP 2: BUILD YOUR PROJECT
==================================================

Before deploying, you need to create a production build:

1. Install dependencies (if not already done):
   npm install

2. Create production build:
   npm run build

This creates a "dist" folder with optimized files ready for deployment.

==================================================
STEP 3: DEPLOY TO NETLIFY (METHOD 1: DRAG & DROP)
==================================================

This is the easiest method for beginners:

1. Go to netlify.com
2. Sign up for a free account (use your email or GitHub account)
3. Once logged in, you'll see the Netlify dashboard
4. Look for the "Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git?" section
5. Drag and drop your "dist" folder directly onto the deployment area
6. Netlify will automatically deploy your site
7. You'll get a random URL like: https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app
8. Your site is now live! 🎉

==================================================
STEP 4: DEPLOY TO NETLIFY (METHOD 2: GITHUB INTEGRATION)
==================================================

This method automatically updates your site when you push changes to GitHub:

1. In Netlify dashboard, click "New site from Git"
2. Choose "GitHub" as your Git provider
3. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account
4. Select your repository: "rushendra-nuthi-portfolio"
5. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: npm run build
   - Publish directory: dist
   - Click "Deploy site"

6. Netlify will:
   - Clone your repository
   - Install dependencies
   - Build your project
   - Deploy to a live URL

==================================================
STEP 5: CUSTOMIZE YOUR NETLIFY SITE
==================================================

1. Change Site Name:
   - Go to Site settings → Site details
   - Click "Change site name"
   - Choose a custom name like: "rushendra-nuthi-portfolio"
   - Your new URL will be: https://rushendra-nuthi-portfolio.netlify.app

2. Add Custom Domain (Optional):
   - If you have your own domain name
   - Go to Site settings → Domain management
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Follow the DNS configuration instructions

3. Environment Variables (if needed):
   - If your app uses environment variables
   - Go to Site settings → Environment variables
   - Add any required variables

==================================================
STEP 6: AUTOMATIC DEPLOYMENTS (GITHUB METHOD ONLY)
==================================================

With GitHub integration, your site updates automatically:

1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated portfolio"
   git push origin main

3. Netlify automatically detects changes and rebuilds your site
4. Your live site updates within 1-2 minutes

==================================================
STEP 7: TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES
==================================================

Problem: Build fails
Solution: 
- Check your package.json has correct build script
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
- Check Netlify build logs for specific errors

Problem: Site shows blank page
Solution:
- Verify build command is "npm run build"
- Check publish directory is "dist"
- Look at browser console for JavaScript errors

Problem: Images not loading
Solution:
- Ensure image paths are relative (start with ./ or /)
- Check that images are in the public folder
- Verify file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

Problem: CSS not loading
Solution:

- Verify all CSS files are being built
- Check for any build errors in Netlify logs

==================================================
STEP 8: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
==================================================

1. Enable Compression:
   - Go to Site settings → Build & deploy → Post processing
   - Enable "Asset optimization"

2. Enable Caching:
   - Go to Site settings → Build & deploy → Post processing
   - Enable "Pretty URLs" and "Bundle splitting"

3. Add Redirects (if needed):

   - Add any redirect rules you need

==================================================
STEP 9: ANALYTICS AND MONITORING
==================================================

1. Enable Netlify Analytics:
   - Go to Site settings → Analytics
